At the age of eight days old, I was stolen from the hospital by my surrogate mother, and raised under the nickname """"""""""""'''''''''''J'''''''''''""""""""""".  I live in the United States Of America, and when I started school at the age of five (5) years old, in the grade of Kindergarten, my real Father found me, and he proved to the Principal of my school, through my birth records, and the kidnapping report that was made out to the police, that I was his daughter, but my surrogate mother who had raised me up until that point and beyond, forced her husband's name of Sterling Jackson Jr. upon me, and making me acknowledge that I was her son, Sterling Jackson III, of which was a stillborn, who was my twin, who was born six (6) minutes before I was, who my surrogate mother immediately named Sterling Jackson III, immediately after his birth, and her and my real Father named me Barbara Anne Smith after I was born.  We were born on March 03, 1970 (03/03/1970)..... To be continued.....
